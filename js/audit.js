/* ---------------- AUDIT LOG ----------------
   Distinct from:
   - processUpdates ("Activity history") — manual announcements posted to the team.
   - state.history ("Month History")     — monthly performance snapshots, archived on demand.
   This is a trail of admin/manager actions that change data (roster edits, shift
   swap approvals, status changes, etc), with before/after values.

   HONESTY NOTE ON INTEGRITY — read before trusting this as "tamper-proof":
   Entries are written with a single, direct Firestore .add() call (an append —
   never an update or delete), which deliberately bypasses pushToFirestore()'s
   batched full-array .set()/.delete() cycle that the rest of this app's shared
   collections (shiftSwaps, processUpdates, and even trackerHistory) go through.
   That existing pattern re-derives the *entire* remote collection from whatever
   is in this browser's local state on every save — including deleting remote
   docs for anything missing locally — so a stale or corrupted local state can
   silently erase shared history. Audit entries are intentionally never part of
   that cycle, so a local state problem cannot delete or rewrite them.
   That fixes "can this app's own normal save cycle destroy audit history" — it
   does NOT make this a tamper-proof audit log. Firestore security rules (not
   shipped by this file — see firestore.rules) must deny update/delete on the
   trackerAuditLog collection for that; and actor attribution below is only as
   trustworthy as the client-side login/session it reads from, since there's no
   server-side identity check. True tamper-evidence (IP/device capture, signed
   server timestamps, an admin who can't rewrite their own trail) needs a real
   backend — e.g. Cloud Functions as the only writer — which this app doesn't have.
